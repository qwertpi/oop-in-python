# oop-in-python
All the code I write while doing [the Raspberry Pi Foundation's MOOC on Object Oriented Programming in Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles)
[character.py](character.py) was provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation during the course as a class defintion to practise inheritance using, thus the copyright for it resides with them
