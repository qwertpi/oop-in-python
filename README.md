# oop-in-python
All the code I write while doing [the Raspberry Pi Foundation's MOOC on Object Oriented Programming in Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles)  
game.py makes use of f-strings and thus will only run on Python 3.6 or later, if you lack a suitable python interpreter go to https://repl.it/github/qwertpi/oop-in-python and enter `python3 game.py` when promted to configure the run button
